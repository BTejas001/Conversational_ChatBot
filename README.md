# 🤖 Conversational Bot (LangChain + Hugging Face)

This is my first experiment toward building agentic AI systems — a lightweight conversational chatbot built using **LangChain** and the **Hugging Face free API**.

🧠 It handles natural dialogue and inference-based answers.  
🛠 Deployed locally using **Flask**.  
📌 No model hosted — the bot calls Hugging Face’s hosted models via API.
